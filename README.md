# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, I've also written unit tests for each part of my code and ensured that it also passed all of them.
